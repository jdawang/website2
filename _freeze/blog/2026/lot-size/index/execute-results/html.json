Looking at the data suggests this comes with some danger if tinkered with too much.\"\nlink-external-newwindow: true\nlink-external-icon: false\n---\n\nIn my [last blog post](../zbr-two-year-review/index.qmd), I analyzed building permits from 2025, paying specific attention to the eight-unit permits. However, city administration's [proposal for the RS zone](https://www.edmonton.ca/residential_neighbourhoods/development-in-your-neighbourhood/infill-changes-feedback) is twofold:\n\n1.  Reduce the hard cap on number of homes permitted per lot to six on interior lots.\n2.  Increase the lot area required per home from 75m^2^ to 90m^2^ on interior lots and 80m^2^ on corners.\n\nAt the same time, [Mayor Knack has mused](https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/knack-open-to-flexible-infill-limits-as-city-reviews-unit-cap) about whether turfing the eight-unit hard cap in favour of a (presumably higher) lot area per home requirement.\n\n> “I think we need to make a change, but what I’m wondering about now is should it be a set number or should it be based on the size of the lot?” he said. “There are lots that are 900 square metres and there are lots that are 400 square metres. If you say six for the sake of six, does that actually make sense?\n\nLet's take a quick look at how different lot size per home thresholds could affect housing in the RS zone, with or without an eight unit hard cap.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nFirst, let's examine the lot size of all RS-zoned properties in Edmonton. @fig-lot-size-dist shows that lot sizes in Edmonton are generally large. I've added dashed lines at where 75m^2^, 80m^2^, and 90m^2^ lot area per unit would allow eight units. This tells us that moving from 75m^2^ to 80m^2^ would be detrimental. Moving to 90m^2^ would sanitize large swaths of the RS zone to having eight homes or more, regardless of the hard cap.\n\n\n::: {#fig-lot-size-dist .cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram.
