I recently wrote an [op-ed in the Edmonton Journal](https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-rezoning-in-garneau-will-improve-housing-options-for-everyone), with Aden Murphy, supporting the City's proposal to upzone much of Garneau.
We argue that upzoning is essential to good housing outcomes for everyone who wants to live in Garneau, students, singles and families.
Keeping houses low-rise will maintain a certain exterior appearance, but at the end of the day, without more supply for everyone, they will be bought out by investors and rented out.
Building more housing of all types is the way out.
